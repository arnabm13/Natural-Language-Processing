The roll were so tiny<end>
Worst sushi rolls ever<end>
Bland, difficult to eat<end>
I wouldn't say the food was bad, but it wasn't good<end>
I think the best word to describe it would be: amateurish<end>
our waiter didn't seem to know much about fish<end>
However, I do have to say, that the food was blah<end>
Sushi was very average and very expensive with no wow factor<end>
Tasted just "bleh"<end>
Miso soup was very salty and ginger salad was made from a lot of weird lettuce that was not cut small and difficult to eat<end>
Took a long time to get the salad<end>
Service was barely ok and kept making excuses why it was taking so long<end>
A Superficial place in Treasure Island, trying too hard to be upscale<end>
the food quality does not meet its price tag, which is way overly priced<end>

Staff also try too hard and gets annoying<end>
Food was good but not memorable<end>
well except the super awful noodle dish<end>
We ordered a lot of food and were really underwhelmed<end>
service was uninspired and our waitress looked really annoyed to have to walk to our table, which was located a bit out of the way<end>
The place is dark with small tables, chairs and booths<end>
 It took them ten minutes to hand us the menus<end>
it came in a tiny portion that can easily be confused as an appetizer<end>
the service is above average<end>
Terribly expensive and it seemed that the staff didn't care too much about what was going on around them<end>

I don't get how people can cook something like chili and send it out to the world when it tastes like nothing<end>
This is the one of the most overrated place in town<end>
 The vegetarian sandwhich is terrible<end>
The bread is terrible<end>
 Long story short, my beans didn\'t have any flavor and didn\'t taste "fresh", the enchilada sauce tasted as if it was from a can, my husbands fish tacos were soggy, no flavor, and chewy (batter)<end>
we did not feel welcome by the cashier the whole time we were there<end>

 Jared (or Gerald), who is the General Manager is by far the most unprofessional manager I\'ve ever had the displeasure of dealing with<end>
I found hair in my pho bowl that was sticking there on the side until I ate half of my pho.<end>
