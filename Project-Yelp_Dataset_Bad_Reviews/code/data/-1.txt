I've given this place too many chances.<end>

'My boyfriend and I were new to Cleveland, so we decided to try out this bar<end>
Wow...it looks like this place does not have many stars from other people<end>
Just want to start off by saying, the bartenders here are amazing and they honestly make this place<end>
When this place first opened they were great<end>
Some friends raved when this business, acquired by Tony Hsieh\'s Downtown Project, re-opened without the casino but with a bar, large lounge area I guess which is for Downtown Project-bots, and a grill<end>
Total shit hole<end>
My wife and I found this place the last time we were in Las Vegas and thought it was pretty interesting<end>
Nice outdoor seating and fun oversize games.Decent food .\n\nThis time we returned with a large group of people to share this experience with . \nThere were about 8 of us and I entered first no problem . A few more entered no problem .I looked back and noticed a commotion at the door with a few remaining friends <end>
"I would give them no stars but I have to give something so I guess one will do! Let me start by saying I'm a local along with my group of friends and I have brought gold spike so much business! Last night my boyfriend was told he couldn't come in because he had a plain white tee on, mind you I was already inside and it was dead in there<end>
On Saturday, 9 July 2016 at approximately 11:40pm, I, Nate walked up to the front door where the first Polynesian Male Security at Re-Entry was very kind and informed which line I needed to be in for Male General Admission. From that moment I greeted all security personnel and complied to all uniform security checks as I, myself, am a Security Manager for a Beach Club and Nightclub<end>
I came here quite some time ago for lunch with a friend. I had previously been to this locale when it was a pizza place and had been anxiousto check Lola's out.\n\nWe sat outside because the weather was nice, I appreciate the effort put into trying to create an pleasan atmosphere despite the fact that Charleston Blvd. traffic is 15 feet away.\n\nMy friend ordered the po-boy and I orrrrrdered the New Orleans style bbq shrimp<end>
'Stopped in this morning for breakfast and out group of three was sorely disappointed<end>
'I was really looking forward to eating at the establishment, based on verbal reviews from friends. Usually I never review a restaurant after the "first look", my standard is 3 visits, but I felt since my two guests have both been here and were very positive I would give it a go. \n\nWe chose to go on a Friday at noon<end>
'Came here last night about 9pm and ordered 4 sandwiches<end>
I do not know if I will go back'<end>
I ordered the Vegetarian Plate<end>
Thought at first it was a bad day for the restaurant. But twice this happened<end>
Based on all the great reviews, I was really disappointed with my BBQ pork banh mi.<end>
'The family and I love the Belle Vernon location. This is no where near as good as the BV location<end>
'The Gelato spot up on the Eglinton Way, This used to my spot for an after lunch or dinner sweet tooth<end>
"BUSY, BUSY Place & I had read LOTS of positive reviews - we waited 50 min. for a table (after being told 30-45 min wait time), crammed 5 ppl. at a table for 4<end>
'It was a nice beautiful place<end>
"I just don't get it.  I have been there twice.  First time was about 2 years ago and both my wife and myself thought it was nothing more than average.  We thought with all the popularity there must be something great here and were somewhat disappointed so decided to try again<end>
I was excited to try after all the hoopla<end>
Booked a room online.<end>
As much as I come to this Denny's, I hate this location. I come here solely on convenience for me and my friends after our basketball games because it's on the way home for the majority of us, but that is all. \n\nI usually come here at night with my friends so I can't speak for anything more than the night staff<end>
Okay well this Denny's has Always served me well until today .. I come in for a late night meal since I'm heading home now and I order the most SIMPLE order eggs bacon and some hash browns and the lady gives our order to these old people sitting right next to us and she tries to give us the old people's order , and let me tell you , I've been literally waiting 30 mins for my food and the old people finish all of MY food<end>
Sonic step up your training and don't leave a newbie by herself on a Friday night<end>
"I've had the subs from Mr goodcents in surprise<end>
I had high hopes for this place since it seemed a little different than the typical airport fare. Turns out I was wrong<end>
Just got done working a long day, come to buffalo wild wings to get a drink after a hard days work<end>
Went there today during a layover.  I ordered a frozen strawberry margarita and chicken quesadillas<end>
This use to be the place to go for college football. My buddies & I have spent a lot of Saturdays here. Most times it would be packed & we would have to get there at least an hour ahead of time to get a seat. O how times have changed.<end>
'As a frequent business traveler, this was my go-to place in the airport between connections.  My usual dish was the chicken verde enchiladas with black beans and rice<end>
I cannot believe the recent great reviews of this place! Had been meaning to go there for awhile and finally did last week as a pre-Christmas dinner,<end>
My family and I arrived at 7:10P.M. on Thursday August 16, 2012.  We were seated outside which is always trouble at this location.  The table that we were seated at had some type of dressing covering the table.  It wasn't some tiny inconspicuous dressing, I could have dipped my wing in the dressing with enough to go back for seconds<end>
b'Captain\'s Log, Stardate 2009-09-17.  \n\nStopped in this junction of the galaxy last night with three friends after spending all day moving my Captain\'s Quarters.  I was sporting my skimpy blue retro work-out shorts with white trim, as I was tired and wasn\'t in the mood to even change.  I garnered a few odd glances (such to be expected) but we were quickly seated<end>
'Back a second time. Not good let me tell ya.  This time a burger. I expected better, way better<end>
'Had dinner here with friends.<end>
 I can not recommend this place.'<end>
To be fair, it has been several months since I visited Brewstone, so things may have changed since then (hopefully for the better).\n\nI am not writ ting this just to be critical; I am hoping the management will read this and make some much needed changes.\n\nSince the place is a Sports bar, I am going to go with that "format"<end>
